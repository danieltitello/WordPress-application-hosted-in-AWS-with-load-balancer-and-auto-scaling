# WordPress application hosted in AWS with load balancer and auto scaling

This application was created for my postgraduate degree. The WordPress is hosted in the AWS servers using RDS database and load balancer and auto scaling.

I also used docker and docker compose to build wordpress. 

The file attached contains screenshots and walks you through the application's settings. Coding is not required to host and work with AWS and Wordpress.
